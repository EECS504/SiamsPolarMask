## Proposed Model
We propose a neural network consisting of two parts: one Siamese subnetwork for feature extraction and one classification-mask subnetwork for polar mask prediction. We will first use resnet-50 as backbone, and the network architecture is shown below.
### Network Architecture
The "star" in the figure below denotes the depth-wise cross correlation.

### Polar Representation
Instead of using pixel level mask (like mask-rcnn), we represent the mask by one center and 36 rays with the same angle interval (10 degrees) in Polar coordinate, as shown below. Since the angle interval is pre-defined, only the length of the ray needs to be predicted. Therefore, we formulate the instance segmentation as instance center classification and dense distance regression in a Polar coordinate.

## How to run
### If using shell: </br >
To run the shell file: `/bin/bash run_my_code.sh`</br >
You can edit the shell by:
`python3 train.py --batch [the batch size] --lr [learning rate] --epochs [# of epochs] --continue_train [continue training]`
### If using IDE: </br >
Click on "run" !

## Training Dataset
1. [MS COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#home) </br >
2. [DAVIS](https://davischallenge.org) </br >
## Tracking Process

## Results
### Detection and Segmentation on MS COCO
Our model can successfully detect and segment the object on MS COCO if given a single image.

### Detection and Segmentation on DAVIS
Our model can successfully detect and segment the object on DAVIS if given a single image.

### Tracking and Segmentation on DAVIS
This is a very challenging task, our model can successfully track the object in some videos (frames 1-5 at the top), but fails in some other videos (frames 1-5 at the bottom).
